# Feature layer (dictionary renderer)

Convert features into graphics to show them with mil2525d symbols.

## Use case

A dictionary renderer uses a style file along with a rule engine to display advanced symbology.
This is useful for displaying features using precise military symbology.

## How to use the sample

Pan and zoom around the map. Observe the displayed military symbology on the map.

## How it works

1. Create a `Geodatabase` using `Geodatabase(geodatabasePath)`.
2. Load the geodatabase asynchronously using `Geodatabase::load()`.
3. Instantiate a `DictionarySymbolStyle`  using `DictionarySymbolStyle::createFromFile(stylePath)`.
4. Wait for geodatabase to completely load by connecting to `Geodatabase::loadStatusChanged` signal.
5. Cycle through each `GeodatabaseFeatureTable` from the geodatabase using `Geodatabase::geodatabaseFeatureTables()`.
6. Create a `FeatureLayer` from each table within the geodatabase using `FeatureLayer(GeodatabaseFeatureTable)`.
7. Load the feature layer asynchronously with `FeatureLayer::load()`.
8. Wait for each layer to load using `FeatureLayer::loadStatusChanged`.
9. After the last layer has loaded, then create a new `Envelope` from a union of the extents of all layers.
   * Set the envelope to be the `Viewpoint` of the map view using `MapView::setViewpoint(Envelope)`.
10. Add the feature layer to map using `Map::operationalLayers()::append(FeatureLayer)`.
11. Create `DictionaryRenderer(DictionarySymbolStyle)` and attach to the feature layer using `FeatureLayer::setRenderer(DictionaryRenderer)`.

## How it works

This sample loads a number of point, line, and polygon feature tables from a Runtime geodatabase. For each feature table, a `FeatureLayer` is created, and a `DictionaryRenderer` object is created and applied to the layer. Note that each layer needs its own renderer, though all renderers can share the DictionarySymbolStyle, in which case all layers will use the same symbology specification (MIL-STD-2525D in the case of this sample). Each layer is added to the map, and when all layers are loaded, the map's viewpoint is set to zoom to the full extent of all feature layers.
