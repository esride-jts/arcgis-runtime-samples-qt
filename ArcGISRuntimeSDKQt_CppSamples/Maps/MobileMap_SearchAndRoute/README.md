# Mobile map (search and route)

Display maps and use locators to enable search and routing offline using a Mobile Map Package.

## Use case

Mobile map packages make it easy to transmit and store the necessary components for an offline map experience including: transportation networks (for routing/navigation), locators (address search, forward and reverse geocoding), and maps.

A field worker might download a mobile map package to support their operations while working offline.

## How to use the sample

A list of maps from a mobile map package will be displayed. If the map contains transportation networks, the list item will have a navigation icon. Click on a map in the list to open it. If a locator task is available, click on the map to place a point. Click it again to reverse geocode the location's address. If transportation networks are available, click the route icon in the top right corner a route will be calculated between geocode locations.

## How it works

1. Create a `MobileMapPackage` passing in the path to the constructor.
2. Get a list model of maps inside the package using the `maps` property.
3. If the package has a locator, access it using the `LocatorTask` property.
4. To see if a map contains transportation networks, check each map's `TransportationNetworks` property.
