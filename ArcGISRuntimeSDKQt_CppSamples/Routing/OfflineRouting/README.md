# Offline routing

This sample demonstrates how to solve a route on-the-fly using offline data.

## How to use the sample

Click near a road to start adding a stop to the route, click again to place it on the map. A number graphic will show its order in the route. After adding at least 2 stops, a route will display. Choose "Fastest" or "Shortest" to control how the route is optimized. To move a stop, click on the graphic, and while continuing to press on the graphic, move the mouse to reposition. Release the mouse to set the new position. The route will update on-the-fly while moving stops. The green box marks the boundary of the route geodatabase.

## How it works

To display a `Route` using a `RouteTask` with offline data:

1. Create the map's `Basemap` from a local tile package using a `TileCache` and `ArcGISTiledLayer`
2. Create a `RouteTask` with an offline locator geodatabase
3. Get the `RouteParameters` using `routeTask.createDefaultParameters()`
4. Create `Stop`s and add them to the route task's parameters.
5. Solve the `Route` using `routeTask.solveRoute(routeParameters)`
6. Create a graphic with the route's geometry and a `SimpleLineSymbol` and display it on another `GraphicsOverlay`.

## About the data

This sample uses a pre-packaged sample dataset consisting of a geodatabase with a San Diego road network and a tile package with a streets basemap.
